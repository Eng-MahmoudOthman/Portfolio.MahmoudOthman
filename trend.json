The platform allows patients to book tests and radiology services online, pay through integrated invoices (gateway), and select the nearest branch for sample collection. Branches can approve bookings online, manage patient services, and generate PDF invoices. Users can register accounts, view all past orders, choose payment methods (cash or card), and print receipts, making the entire medical booking and billing process seamless, automated, and traceable." ,
